Python attributes
==================

Comparison across types is aided by some shared creation
methods like ``.first()``, as well a the ``LexType`` class,
which contains bookkeeping information such as a list of
all lexical classes.

For example, we can examine the ``spec`` attribute for an
item of each lexical type with this code::

    rows = [
        (item, item.spec)
        for item in (
            member.cls.first()
            for member in LexType
        )
    ]


spec
-----

A ``spec`` is a tuple built from integers, strings. These
can nest to become complex, but only with tuples built
from integers and strings, and so on. The spec should
contain all the information to recreate the object, so
long as you know its original type.

.. csv-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: auto
    :generator: lex-eg-table
    :generator-args: spec
    :classes: lex-eg-table flex-last spec-table

We can use the spec as arguments to create the item. For example:

.. doctest::

    >>> from pytableaux.lang import Predicated
    >>> Predicated((0, 0, 1), (('Constant', (0, 0)),))
    <Sentence: Fa>

.. _lexical-item-idents-table:

ident
-------

The ``ident`` attribute is similar to ``spec``, but also
contains the `type` information. Thus an ``ident`` attribute
is just a `2tuple`, or `ordered pair` of the type name, and
the spec.

.. csv-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: auto
    :generator: lex-eg-table
    :generator-args: ident
    :classes: lex-eg-table flex-last ident-table

We can pass the ident tuple as a single argument to `LexicalAbc`
to create the item. For example:

.. doctest::

    >>> from pytableaux.lang import LexicalAbc, Predicate, Quantifier
    >>> LexicalAbc(('Predicate', (0, 0, 1))) == Predicate(0, 0, 1)
    True
    >>> LexicalAbc(('Quantifier', ('Existential',))) is Quantifier.Existential
    True
    >>> LexicalAbc(('Quantified', ('Existential', (0, 0), ('Predicated', ((0, 0, 1), (('Variable', (0, 0)),))))))
    <Sentence: âˆƒxFx>

.. _lexical-item-sort_tuple-table:

sort tuple
----------

A ``sort_tuple`` is a flat tuple of integers that encodes
less information overall, but should still be unique for 
distinct items. It might not contain enough information to
recreate an object, but it provides a convenient method for
comparing, sorting, and hashing items. This works across
different types, for example between a `predicate` and a
`quantifier`, without the risk of confusing one for the other.

.. csv-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: auto
    :generator: lex-eg-table
    :generator-args: sort_tuple
    :classes: lex-eg-table flex-last sort-tuple-table

For example:

.. doctest::

    >>> from pytableaux.lang import Constant, Variable
    >>> c = Constant(0,0)
    >>> v = Variable(0,0)
    >>> c.spec == v.spec
    True
    >>> v > c
    True
