L3 - Łukasiewicz 3-valued Logic
*******************************

Ł3 is a three-valued logic with values :m:`T`, :m:`F`, and :m:`N`. It is
similar to :ref:`K3`, but with a different, primitive conditional 
operator that respects the Law of Conditional Identity (:s:`A $ A`).

    Logical Consequence
    ===================

    **Logical Consequence** is defined just like in :ref:`CPL` and :ref:`K3`:

    * *C* is a **Logical Consequence** of *A* iff all models where the value of *A* is :m:`T`
      are models where *C* also has the value :m:`T`.
