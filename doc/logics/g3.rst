G3 - Gödel 3-valued logic
*************************

Gödel 3-valued logic (:m:`T`, :m:`F`, and :m:`N`) with classical-like negation.

    Semantics
    =========

    .. autoclass:: Model

        .. method:: truth_function(operator, a, b)

            The value of a sentence with a truth-functional operator is determined by
            the values of its operands according to the following tables.

            //truth_tables//g3//

    Tableaux System
    ===============

    .. autoclass:: TableauxSystem
        :members: build_trunk

    .. autoclass:: TableauxRules
        :members:

    Logical Consequence
    ===================

    **Logical Consequence** is defined just like in :ref:`CPL <CPL>` and :ref:`K3 <K3>`:

    * *C* is a **Logical Consequence** of *A* iff all models where the value of *A* is :m:`T`
      are models where *C* also has the value :m:`T`.
