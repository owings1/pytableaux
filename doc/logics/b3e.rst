*************************************
B3E - Bochvar 3-valued External Logic
*************************************

B3E is a three-valued logic with values :m:`T`, :m:`F`, and :m:`N`. B3E is similar
to :ref:`K3W <K3W>`, with a special Assertion operator, that always results in a classical
value (:m:`T` or :m:`F`).

    Semantics
    =========

    .. autoclass:: Model

        .. autoattribute:: truth_values

        .. autoattribute:: designated_values

        .. autoattribute:: extensions

        .. autoattribute:: anti_extensions

        .. autoattribute:: atomics

        .. method:: truth_function(operator, a, b)

            The value of a sentence with a truth-functional operator is determined by
            the values of its operands according to the following tables.

            //truth_tables//b3e//

            Note that the conditional operator :oper:`Conditional` is definable in terms of the
            assertion operator :oper:`Assertion`:
            
            .. centered:: :s:`A $ B` :math:`:=` :s:`~*A V *B` 

            Bochvar also defined `external` versions of :oper:`Conjunction` and :oper:`Disjunction`
            using the assertion operator:

            * External conjunction: :s:`*A & *B`
            * External disjunction: :s:`*A V *B`

            These connectives always result in a classical value. For compatibility,
            we use the standard `internal` readings of :oper:`Conjunction` and :oper:`Disjunction`,
            and use the `internal` reading for :oper:`Conditional` and :oper:`Biconditional`.

        .. method:: value_of_predicated(sentence)

            B3E predication is defined just as in :ref:`K3 <K3>`:

            .. include:: include/k3/m.predication.rst

        .. method:: value_of_existential(sentence)

            Existential quantification is defined just as in :ref:`FDE <FDE>`:

            .. include:: include/fde/m.existential.rst

        .. method:: value_of_universal(sentence)

            Universal quantification is defined just as in :ref:`FDE <FDE>`:

            .. include:: include/fde/m.existential.rst
        
    Logical Consequence
    ===================

    **Logical Consequence** is defined just like in :ref:`K3 <k3-consequence>`:

    Notes
    =====

    * Unlike :ref:`K3W`, B3E has some logical truths. For example :s:`(A $ B) V ~(A $ B)`.
      This logical truth is an instance of the Law of Excluded Middle.

    * The assertion operator can expression alternate versions of validities that
      fail in :ref:`K3W`. For example, :s:`A` implies :s:`A V *B` in B3E, which fails in
      :ref:`K3W`.
