B3E - Bochvar 3-valued External Logic
*************************************

B3E is a three-valued logic with values **T**, **F**, and **N**. B3E is similar
to `K3W`_, with a special Assertion operator, that always results in a classical
value (**T** or **F**).

    Logical Consequence
    ===================

    **Logical Consequence** is defined just like in `CPL`_ and `K3`_:

    * *C* is a **Logical Consequence** of *A* iff all models where the value of *A* is **T**
      are models where *C* also has the value **T**.

    Notes
    =====

    * Unlike `K3W`_, B3E has some logical truths. For example :s:`(A $ B) V ~(A $ B)`.
      This logical truth is an instance of the Law of Excluded Middle.

    * The assertion operator can expression alternate versions of validities that
      fail in `K3W`_. For example, :s:`A` implies :s:`A V *B` in B3E, which fails in
      `K3W`_.
