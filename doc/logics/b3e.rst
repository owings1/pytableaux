*************************************
B3E - Bochvar 3-valued External Logic
*************************************

B3E is a three-valued logic with values :m:`T`, :m:`F`, and :m:`N`. B3E is similar
to :ref:`K3W`, with a special Assertion operator, that always results in a classical
value (:m:`T` or :m:`F`).

    Logical Consequence
    ===================

    **Logical Consequence** is defined just like in :ref:`CPL` and :ref:`K3`:

    * *C* is a **Logical Consequence** of *A* iff all models where the value of *A* is :m:`T`
      are models where *C* also has the value :m:`T`.

    Notes
    =====

    * Unlike :ref:`K3W`, B3E has some logical truths. For example :s:`(A $ B) V ~(A $ B)`.
      This logical truth is an instance of the Law of Excluded Middle.

    * The assertion operator can expression alternate versions of validities that
      fail in :ref:`K3W`. For example, :s:`A` implies :s:`A V *B` in B3E, which fails in
      :ref:`K3W`.
