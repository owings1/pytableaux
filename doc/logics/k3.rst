L{K3} - Strong Kleene Logic
********************************

.. contents:: :local:

L{K3} is a three-valued logic (V{T}, V{F}, and V{N}). It can be understood
as {@FDE} without the V{B} value.

.. automodule:: logics.k3

    Semantics
    =========

    .. _k3-model:

    .. autoclass:: Model

        .. autoclass:: logics.k3::Model.Value()
            :members: F, N, T
            :undoc-members:

        .. include:: include/fde/m.attributes.rst

        .. method:: truth_function(operator, a, b)

            The value of a sentence with a truth-functional operator is determined by
            the values of its operands according to the following tables.

            //truth_tables//k3//

        .. method:: value_of_predicated(sentence)

            Like L{FDE}, L{K3} predication defines a predicate's
            *extenstion* and *anti-extension*. The value of a predicated sentence
            is determined as follows:

            .. include:: include/k3/m.predication.rst

            Note, unlike L{FDE}, there is an *exclusivity constraint*
            on a predicate's extension/anti-extension. This means that :m:`ntuple`
            cannot be in **both** the extension and the anti-extension of `P`.

            Like L{FDE}, there is no *exhaustion constraint*: there are
            permissible L{K3} models where some tuple :m:`ntuple` is in **neither**
            the extension nor the anti-extension of some predicate :math:`P`.

        .. method:: value_of_existential(sentence)

            The Existential quantifier :s:`X` is interpreted similary to
            :ref:`FDE <fde-model>`, without the V{B} value.

            .. include:: include/k3/m.existential.rst

        .. method:: value_of_universal(sentence)

            The Universal quantifier :s:`L` is interpreted similary to
            :ref:`FDE <fde-model>`, without the V{B} value.

            .. include:: include/k3/m.universal.rst

    .. _k3-consequence:

    Logical Consequence
    -------------------

    **Logical Consequence** uses the same formulation as {@CPL consequence}:

        .. include:: include/k3/m.consequence.rst

    Alternatively, we can use the formulating of {@FDE consequence} in terms of
    *designated* values, since L{K3} has only the designated value V{T}.

    Notes
    -----

    Some notable features of L{K3} include:

    * Everything valid in L{FDE} is valid in L{K3}.

    * Like L{FDE}, the Law of Excluded Middle, and Conditional
      Identity :s:`(A $ A)` fail.

    * Some cassical validities, such as *Modus Ponens*, *Modus Tollens*,
      *Disjunctive Syllogism*, and *DeMorgan* laws, are valid.
