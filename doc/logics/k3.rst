L{K3} is a three-valued logic with values V{T}, V{F}, and V{N}. It can be understood
as {@FDE} without the V{B} value.

Semantics
=========

.. _k3-truth-values:

Truth Values
------------

Common labels for the values include:

.. include:: include/k3/value-table.rst

.. rubric:: Designated Values

The set of *designated values* for L{K3} is the singleton: { V{T} }

.. _k3-truth-tables:

Truth Tables
------------

.. include:: include/truth_table_blurb.rst

.. truth-tables::
  :operators: Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction

.. rubric:: Defined Operators

The `Material Conditional` :s:`>` is definable in terms of disjunction:

.. sentence::

  A > B := ~A V B

Likewise the `Material Biconditional` :s:`<` is defined in terms of :s:`>`
and :s:`&`:

.. sentence::

  A < B := (A > B) & (B > A)

.. truth-tables::
  :operators: MaterialConditional, MaterialBiconditional

.. rubric:: Compatibility Tables

L{K3} does not have separate `Assertion` or `Conditional` operators,
but we include tables and rules for them, for cross-compatibility.

.. truth-tables::
  :operators: Assertion, Conditional, Biconditional

.. _k3-predication:

Predication
-----------

Like L{FDE}, L{K3} predication defines a predicate's *extenstion* and
*anti-extension*. The value of a predicated sentence is determined as
follows:

.. include:: include/k3/m.predication.rst

Note, unlike L{FDE}, there is an *exclusivity constraint*
on a predicate's extension/anti-extension. This means that !{ntuple}
cannot be in *both* the extension and the anti-extension of :m:`P`.

Like L{FDE}, there is no *exhaustion constraint*: there are
permissible L{K3} models where some tuple !{ntuple} is in *neither*
the extension nor the anti-extension of some predicate :m:`P`.

.. _k3-quantification:

Quantification
--------------

.. rubric:: Existential

.. include:: include/fde/m.existential.rst

.. rubric:: Universal

.. include:: include/fde/m.universal.rst

.. _k3-consequence:

Consequence
-----------

**Logical Consequence** is defined in terms of the set of *designated* values
{ V{T} }:

  .. include:: include/fde/m.consequence.rst

.. _k3-system:

Tableaux
========

L{K3} tableaux are built similary to L{FDE}.

Nodes
-----

.. include:: include/fde/nodes_blurb.rst

Trunk
-----

.. include:: include/fde/trunk_blurb.rst

.. tableau::
  :build-trunk:
  :prolog:

Closure
-------

L{K3} includes the L{FDE} closure rule.

.. tableau::
  :rule: DesignationClosure
  :legend:
  :doc:

L{K3} includes an additional `glut` closure rule. This means a branch closes
when a sentence and its negation both appear as designated nodes on the branch.

.. tableau::
  :rule: GlutClosure
  :legend:
  :doc:

.. _k3-rules:

Rules
--------

.. cssclass:: hidden

  .. class:: TabRules()

.. include:: include/fde/rules_blurb.rst

.. tableau-rules::
  :docflags:
  :group: operator
  :exclude: Assertion, Conditional, Biconditional

.. tableau-rules::
  :docflags:
  :group: quantifier

.. tableau-rules::
  :docflags:
  :title: Compatibility Rules
  :group: operator
  :include: Assertion, Conditional, Biconditional


Notes
=====

Some notable features of L{K3} include:

* L{K3} is an :term:`extension of` L{FDE}.

* Like L{FDE}, the :term:`Law of Excluded Middle`, and
  :term:`Conditional Identity` fail.

* Some classical validities are valid, such as :term:`Modus Ponens`,
  :term:`Modus Tollens`, :term:`Disjunctive Syllogism`, and :term:`DeMorgan laws`.
