K3 - Strong Kleene Logic
************************

K3 is a three-valued logic (**T**, **F**, and **N**). It can be understood as `FDE`_
without the **B** value.

    Semantics
    =========

    .. autoclass:: Model

        .. automethod:: value_of_operated(sentence)

        .. method:: value_of_predicated(sentence)

            A sentence with predicate `P` with parameters `<p,...>` has the value:

            * **T** iff `<p,...>` is in the extension of `P` and not in the anti-extension of `P`.
            * **F** iff `<p,...>` is in the anti-extension of `P` and not in the extension of `P`.
            * **N** iff `<p,...>` is neither in the extension nor anti-extension of `P`.

            Note, unlike `FDE`_, there is an exclusivity constraint on a predicate's
            extension/anti-extension. This means that `<p,...>` cannot be in both the
            extension and the anti-extension of `P`. Like `FDE`_, there is not exhaustion
            restraint.

    Tableaux System
    ===============

    .. autoclass:: TableauxSystem
        :members: build_trunk

    .. autoclass:: TableauxRules

    Logical Consequence
    ===================

    **Logical Consequence** is defined just like in `CPL`_:

    * *C* is a **Logical Consequence** of *A* iff all models where the value of *A* is **T**
      are models where *C* also has the value **T**.

    Notes
    =====

    Some notable features of K3 include:

    * Everything valid in `FDE`_ is valid in K3.

    * Like `FDE`_, the law of excluded middle, and Conditional Identity P{(A $ A)} fail.

    * Unlike `FDE`_, K3 has some logical truths, for example the Law of Non-Contradiction,
      P{~(A & ~A)}, and Conditional Identity P{A $ A}.

    * Some Classical validities, such as Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Disjunctive Syllogism,
      and DeMorgan laws, are valid.
