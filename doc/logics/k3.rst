********************************
L{K3} - Strong Kleene Logic
********************************

.. contents:: :local:

L{K3} is a three-valued logic (V{T}, V{F}, and V{N}). It can be understood
as {@FDE} without the V{B} value.

.. automodule:: logics.k3

    Semantics
    =========

    .. _k3-model:

    .. autoclass:: Model

      .. autoclass:: logics.k3::Model.Value()
          :members: F, N, T
          :undoc-members:

      .. include:: include/fde/m.attributes.rst

    .. _k3-truth-tables:

    Truth Tables
    ------------

    .. include:: include/truth_table_blurb.rst

    //truth_tables//k3//

    .. _k3-predication:

    Predication
    -----------

    Like L{FDE}, L{K3} predication defines a predicate's *extenstion* and
    *anti-extension*. The value of a predicated sentence is determined as
    follows:

    .. include:: include/k3/m.predication.rst

    Note, unlike L{FDE}, there is an *exclusivity constraint*
    on a predicate's extension/anti-extension. This means that !{ntuple}
    cannot be in *both* the extension and the anti-extension of :math:`P`.

    Like L{FDE}, there is no *exhaustion constraint*: there are
    permissible L{K3} models where some tuple !{ntuple} is in *neither*
    the extension nor the anti-extension of some predicate :math:`P`.

    .. _k3-quantification:

    Quantification
    --------------

    The quantifiers :s:`X` and :s:`L` are interpreted similary to
    {@FDE <fde-quantification>}, without the V{B} value.

    Existential
    ^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. include:: include/k3/m.existential.rst

    Universal
    ^^^^^^^^^

    .. include:: include/k3/m.universal.rst

    .. _k3-consequence:

    Consequence
    -----------

    **Logical Consequence** uses the same formulation as {@CPL consequence}:

    .. include:: include/k3/m.consequence.rst

    Alternatively, we can use the formulation of {@FDE consequence} in terms of
    *designated* values, since L{K3} has only the designated value V{T}.

    Tableaux System

    Notes
    -----

    Some notable features of L{K3} include:

    * Everything valid in L{FDE} is valid in L{K3}.

    * Like L{FDE}, the Law of Excluded Middle, and Conditional
      Identity :s:`(A $ A)` fail.

    * Some cassical validities, such as *Modus Ponens*, *Modus Tollens*,
      *Disjunctive Syllogism*, and *DeMorgan* laws, are valid.
