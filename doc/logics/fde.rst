FDE - First Degree Entailment
*****************************

FDE is a 4-valued logic (**T**, **F**, **N** and **B**). A common interpretation of these
values is:

- **T**: just true
- **F**: just false
- **N**: neither true nor false
- **B**: both true and false

    Logical Consequence
    ===================

    **Logical Consequence** is defined in terms of the *designated* values **T** and **B**:

    * *C* is a **Logical Consequence** of *A* iff all models where *A* has a *desginated* value
      (**T** or **B**) are models where *C* also has a *designated* value.

    Notes
    =====

    Some notable features of FDE include:

    * No logical truths. The means that the Law of Excluded Middle P{A V ~A}, and the
      Law of Non-Contradiction P{~(A & ~A)} fail, as well as Conditional Identity P{A $ A}.
  
    * Failure of Modus Ponens, Modus Tollens, Disjunctive Syllogism, and other Classical validities.

    * DeMorgan laws are valid, as well as Conditional Contraction (P{A $ (A $ B)} implies P{A $ B}).
