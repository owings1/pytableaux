Predicated sentences in a model are interpreted via a predicate's *extension*
and *anti-extension*.

A sentence with *n*-ary predicate :m:`P` over parameters !{ntuple}
has the value:

* V{T} iff !{ntuple} is in the *extension* of :m:`P` and
  not in the *anti-extension* of :m:`P`.

* V{F} iff !{ntuple} is in the *anti-extension* of :m:`P`
  and not in the *extension* of :m:`P`.

* V{B} iff !{ntuple} is in *both* the extension and anti-extension
  of :m:`P`.

* V{N} iff !{ntuple} is in *neither* in the extension nor the 
  anti-extension of :m:`P`.
