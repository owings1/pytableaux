A sentence with predicate `P` with parameters !{ntuple} is assigned a
value as follows:

* V{T} iff !{ntuple} is in the extension of `P` and not in the
    anti-extension of `P`.

* V{F} iff !{ntuple} is in the anti-extension of `P` and not
    in the extension of `P`.

* V{B} iff !{ntuple} is in both the extension and anti-extension
    of `P`.
