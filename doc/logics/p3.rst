P3 - Post 3-valued logic
************************

Emil Post's three-valued logic (**T**, **F**, and **N**) has a deviant negation
that performs a *cyclic shift* in value. The result is a system much different
from classical logic, as well as more well-known many-valued systems.

    Logical Consequence
    ===================

    **Logical Consequence** is defined just like in `CPL`_ and `K3`_:

    * *C* is a **Logical Consequence** of *A* iff all models where the value of *A* is **T**
      are models where *C* also has the value **T**.
