    Emil Post

Emil Post's three-valued logic (V{T}, V{F}, and V{N}) has a deviant negation
that performs a *cyclic shift* in value. The result is a system much different
from :ref:`CFOL`, as well as more well-known many-valued systems.

    Semantics
    =========

    .. _p3-model:

    .. autoclass:: Model

        .. autoclass:: pytableaux.logics.p3::Model.Value()
            :members: F, N, T
            :undoc-members:

        .. include:: include/fde/m.attributes.rst

        .. method:: truth_function(operator, a, b)

            The value of a sentence with a truth-functional operator is determined
            by the values of its operands according to the following tables.

            Most notable is the behavior of negation. Disjunction :s:`V` is the same
            as in :ref:`K3 <K3>`, but conjunction is quite different, which is defined
            in terms of disjunction in the standard way as :s:`~(~A V ~B)`.

            .. truth-tables::

        .. method:: value_of_predicated(sentence)

            Predication is given the same treatment as :ref:`K3 <k3-model>`,
            defined in terms of a predicate's *extenstion* and *anti-extension*.

            .. include:: include/k3/m.predication.rst

        .. method:: value_of_existential(sentence)

            Existential quantification is defined just as in :ref:`K3 <k3-model>`:

            .. include:: include/k3/m.existential.rst

        .. method:: value_of_universal(sentence)

            .. Note:: L{P3} did not originally define quantification. This is a novel
               construction.

            The :s:`L` quantifier is thought of like `generalized conjunction`.
            Given that :s:`A & B` is defined as :s:`~(~A V ~B)`, we interpret :s:`L`
            in the following way. Take the set of values of the sentence resulting
            from the substitution of the variable with each constant. Then apply
            the negation function to each of those values. Then take the maximum
            of those values (the `generalized disjunction`), and apply the negation
            function to that maximum value. The result is the value of the universal
            sentence.

    Consequence
    -----------

    Logical consequence is defined just like in L{K3}:
