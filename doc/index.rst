pytableaux documentation
========================

pytableaux is a multi-logic tableau proof generator. It supports full first-order 
sentences (predication and quantification), with standard operators (negation, 
conjunction, etc.), as well as modal operators (possibility, necessity). It is 
designed to compare logical validities across various 'nonclassical' logics, 
focusing on many-valued and modal logics.
